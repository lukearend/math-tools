    "Neuronal activity causes local changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the blood, which can be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). One drawback of fMRI is that the haemodynamic response (blood flow in response to neural activity) is much slower than the underlying neural responses. We can model the delay and spread of the measurements relative to the neural signals using a linear shift-invariant system\n",

Your goal is to estimate the HRF, $h$, from the data. Each of these signals are sampled at 1 Hz. Plot vectors $r$ and $x$ versus time to get a sense for the data. Use the `stem` command (or `plt.stem` in Python) for $x$, and label the x-axis."

Write a function `createConvMat`, that takes as arguments an input vector $x$ and $M$ (the dimensionality of $h$) and generates a matrix $X$ such that the response $r = Xh$ is as defined in Eq. (1) for any $h$. Verify that the matrix generated by your function produces the same response as Matlab’s `conv` function when applied to a few random $h$ vectors of length $M = 15$. Visualize the matrix $X$ as an image (evaluate `imagesc(X)` in MATLAB or `plt.imshow` in Python), and describe its structure."
