Plot this, against the corresponding entries of the time vector, on top of the original data (use matlab’s `hold` function, and plot with flag `'r*-'`). Is the subsampling operation linear? Shift-invariant? How does this reduced version of the data look, compared to the original? Does it provide a good summary of the original measurements? Explain."

By convention, the “Delta” band corresponds to frequencies less than 4 Hz, “Theta” band is 4-7 Hz, “Alpha” band 8-15 Hz, and “Beta” is 16-31 Hz. For these data, which band shows the strongest signal? Is there any power in frequencies outside of these known bands, and if so can you explain the origin of this part of the signal?"
